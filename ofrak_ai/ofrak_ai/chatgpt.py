    Models ending in 4-digit long sequences are snapshots of their respective models. These are
    static versions that receive no updates and will be deprecated 3 months after the newest
    version is released.

    GPT-4-32k models have a max token value of 32,768 (4x higher than standard GPT-4).

    GPT-4 offers a larger model better optimized for chat than GPT-3.5-turbo as well as a higher max
    token size (8,192 tokens vs 4,096). GPT-3.5 offers better cost efficiency.

    Note: GPT-4 is currently in limited beta. Make sure that you have access to GPT-4 through
    OpenAI before attempting to use any of the GPT-4 models with OFRAK AI.
